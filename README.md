# 🌤️ Weather Dashboard 🌐

A simple, interactive weather dashboard built using **Streamlit** and the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
This application allows users to fetch real-time weather data for any city around the world, including temperature, humidity, and a short weather description.

---

## 📌 Features

- Enter any city name globally to view its current weather
- Displays:
  - Temperature (in °C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Weather conditions (like Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, etc.)
- Clean and responsive web interface
- International city support using OpenWeatherMap’s city query API
- Secure API key management using **Streamlit Cloud Secrets**

---

## 🚀 Approach

1. **Fetched real-time weather data** using the [OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) based on the city name input by the user.
2. Created a **Streamlit-based web interface** with a text input field and a button to trigger the API call.
3. **Displayed fetched weather data** in a clean, user-friendly format using Streamlit widgets.
4. Handled potential errors like invalid city names gracefully.
5. Managed sensitive API keys securely:
   - **Locally** via `.env` file (using `python-dotenv`)
   - **On Streamlit Cloud** via **Streamlit Secrets Manager**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Streamlit** — for building the interactive web UI
- **Requests** — for making HTTP API calls
- **OpenWeatherMap API** — to fetch real-time weather data
- **python-dotenv** — to manage environment variables securely in local development
- **Streamlit Cloud Secrets** — for secure API key management on the deployed app
